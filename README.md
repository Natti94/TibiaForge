- Media area: News, Video, Images, and Highscores Statistics
  - News: simple carousel with prev/next and readable page indicator

- Auth scaffolding: Login/Register views with refined layout
- Live summary in the Optimizer: armor, resistances, skill totals, attack/damage, effective magic level
- Cloudinary-hosted assets via `.env` (development) and Netlify Function in production
- React + Vite + React Router; SPA-friendly `_redirects` for Netlify

## Local development

From `tibia-optimizer-app/`:

```powershell
cd tibia-optimizer-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

- App runs at http://localhost:5173/
- Uses Vite; hot reload is on by default

## Environment variables

Create `tibia-optimizer-app/.env` with the assets you use in the UI (examples):

```
# Optional TibiaData base (defaults to https://api.tibiadata.com)
VITE_TIBIADATA_BASE=

# Cloudinary (dev only). In prod, assets are fetched via Netlify Function.
VITE_CLOUDINARY_NEWS_BANNER=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_STATISTICS_BANNER=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_BACKGROUND=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_TITLE=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_TITLE_EFFECT=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_BOOK_GIF=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_TITLE_SMALL=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_ABOUT_ICON=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_GUIDE_ICON=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CONTACT_ICON=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_COOPERATION_ICON=
VITE_CLOUDINARY_DONATE_ICON=
```

In development the app reads directly from these URLs. In production (Netlify), assets are fetched via the Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/getAssets.js`).

## Build and deploy (Netlify)

```powershell
cd tibia-optimizer-app
npm run build
```

- Publish directory: `dist`
- Ensure `public/_redirects` is included (Vite copies it to `dist/`)
- Optional: configure a Netlify Function for asset indirection (see `netlify/functions/getAssets.js`)

## Troubleshooting

- Missing images or video: verify your `.env` values (Cloudinary URLs)
- SPA 404 on refresh: ensure `_redirects` is present in the built `dist/`
- Dev server port in use: change Vite port in `vite.config.js` or stop the other process
- Windows path casing: keep import paths consistent (e.g., `components/optimizer/...`) to avoid casing-only conflicts
